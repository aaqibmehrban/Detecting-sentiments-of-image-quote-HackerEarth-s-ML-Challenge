# Detecting-sentiments-of-image-quote-`love_is-love` (HackerEarth's ML Challenge)
A HackerEarthâ€™s ML Challenge based on Detecting sentiments of image quote using unsupervised Machine Learning techniques and knowledge of OCR and NLP to build a model that analyzes sentiments of a quote and classifies them into `positive`, `negative`, or `random`.

### My Approach
> * Used glob to extract all the paths for the images
> * In one approach i used **cv2 and pytesseract library** (images needs to be preprocessed using cv2 library) to read the text from the .jpg files.
> * And in other i used **easyocr library** (gave better results) to read the text from the .jpg files.
> * Removed **\n** and **contraction** then applied some spelling correction and created Sentiment scores using `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` & `TextBlob Sentiment polarity score`
> * Removed Non alphabets, Stopwords and applied lemmatization
> * Created TFIDF vectors for the text
> * Created vector represenation for each comment
> * Stacked all these features i.e. `Sentiment scores`, `TFIDF Vectors`, `Comment Vectors` And used these as features to cluster the comments in 3 groups using `Kmeans`.
> * Further by inspection detected the comment types in the cluster and mapped `Random`, `Negative`, `Positive` accordingly.
